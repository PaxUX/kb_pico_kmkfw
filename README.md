This is a keyboard layout for a kmkfw project

UPDATE:  this is for a single PICO setup so it controls both keypads directly

The following the 3D STL location for the keyboard

For more details on how to setup read their site:
  http://kmkfw.io/docs/Getting_Started/

There are two programs here.
- code.py which is the main keyboard
- scankeyboard.py which is a utility code to get keymaps needed for a keyboard setup
